## Overview

**My Own Game** is a minimal 2D shooter built from scratch using Python.  
The project is designed as a personal experiment to explore basic game mechanics like movement, key detection, and bullet logic — all without external game engines.

It's ideal for learning fundamental game loop concepts and event-driven programming in Python.

## Features

- Dual square characters with real-time movement
- Simple keyboard-based shooting system
- Independent bullet handling
- Basic collision boundaries and frame refresh logic
- Modular code structure for future expansion

---

## Technologies

- Python 3.10+
- Standard libraries (`keyboard`, `time`, etc.)
- (Optional for future expansion: `pygame`)
