# 🕹️ My Own Game

**My Own Game** is a simple 2D shooter prototype developed in Python.  
It features two movable square characters that can shoot each other using keyboard controls.  
The project is currently in early development and serves as a foundation for experimenting with game mechanics, collision detection, and real-time input handling.
